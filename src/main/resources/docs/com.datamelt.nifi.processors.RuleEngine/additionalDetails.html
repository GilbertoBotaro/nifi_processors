        <p>
            Processor runs the business rules engine - JaRE - against the content of a flowfile.
            The flowfile is expected to be a single line of CSV data. The business logic in a ruleengine project 
            file is checked against the data of the individual fields and the result of the execution
            is assigned to the flowfile attributes.
